								<h2>Predicting New York Times Cooking Recipe Popularity</h2>
								<p>Below is a brief summary of my project. More detailed information, including code and further analysis, can be found on my <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/NYT_cooking_recipe_popularity">Github</a></span> and slides for a presentation on this project can be found <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/NYT_cooking_recipe_popularity/blob/main/NYT_cooking_Serigano.pdf">here</a></span>.</p>
								<h2>Summary</h2>
								<p><span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/">NYT Cooking</a></span> is a subscription service and digital source for 20,000+ recipes from The New York Times. The site also includes how-to guides for home cooks of every level, weekly cooking newsletters, and recipe suggestions. Subscribers also have access to a recipe box where they can store their favorite recipes for future use. Recipes on the site include many common recipe features as well as links to related content and keywords that lead one to similar recipes. The website also has a 5 star rating system and the ability for users to leave comments related to their experience with the recipes.</p>
								<p>In the digital age, online traffic and engagement are huge metrics of success for a website. This can be monitored in a number of different ways, including via total number of recipe ratings. Since NYT Cooking is a paid subscription service, the retention of existing, loyal subscribers and acquisition of new subscribers is key. This can only be accomplished by creating engaging content for users.</p>
								<p>In order for NYT Cooking to continue their growing platform and ongoing success, they must maintain and increase overall site traffic and continue to attract new users. <b>This project aims to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Determine how NYT Cooking can improve their recipe popularity and overall site traffic through web scraping of open access recipe data.</li>
									<li>Determine what characteristics of a recipe are most likely to increase the overall popularity, and thus lead to higher site traffic.</li>
									<li>Recommend changes that can be made to a recipe before posting.</li></ul></b>
								</ul>
								<p>In order to answer these questions, I built a classification model to predict whether a recipe will create higher than average site traffic based on several recipe features including recipe description, yield, total time for preparation, ingredients, date posted, author, and many other features. The number of ratings per recipe was used as a proxy for recipe popularity and overall site traffic and around 7,600 recipes were scraped for analysis from NYT Cooking. </p>
								<p>Multiple classification models were developed with hyperparameter tuning in order to determine which classifier produced the most accurate model predictions. After determining the best performing model, I retrieved the importance of each recipe feature in the model and was able to provide recommendations to NYT Cooking on how to increase a recipeâ€™s popularity and increase overall site traffic. The conclusions to this project are listed below and a more detailed analysis can be found on my Github.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Rating itself is highly correlated to the number of ratings a recipe receives, meaning people are more likely to interact with a recipe they really enjoyed.</li>
									<li>Generally, wordier recipes tend to perform better and have a higher number of reviews, perhaps because these recipes include more detailed information and lead to better results.</li>
									<li>Comfort foods such as desserts and pastas perform better than other recipes and lead to more site traffic.</li>
									<li>Some authors have very dedicated followers. Melissa Clark (the "Queen of NYT Cooking"), David Tanis, and Alison Roman always produce very popular recipes.</li>
									<li>Subscribers enjoy christmas recipes, which isn't a surprise since NYT Cooking is known for their christmas cookie recipes.</li>
									<li>Recipes including the ingredients butter, chickpeas, almonds, and chicken produce higher than average site traffic.</li>
									<li>Dairy-free recipes or recipes including celery, cinnamon, and fennel have a negative correlation to rating count and do not typically perform well.</li>
								</ul>
