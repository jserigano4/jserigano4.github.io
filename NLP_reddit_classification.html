								<h2>NLP Reddit Classification</h2>
								<p>Below is a brief summary of my project. More detailed information, including code and further analysis, can be found on my <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/NLP_reddit_classification">Github</a></span> and slides for a presentation on this project can be found <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/NLP_reddit_classification/blob/main/NLP_reddit_classification_Serigano.pdf">here</a></span>.</p>
								<h2>Summary</h2>
								<p>Reddit is a social network of threads organized by subject and separated by interests. Users can post to these individual subreddits and interact with other members who share similar interests. The popularity of Reddit 
									means there is a wealth of data that continues to grow daily, making it the perfect platform to aggregate data and analyze these data sets to note trends or make predictions. The ability to predict the subreddit from which 
									a post originated is an example of a classification model that could be useful to members of the Reddit team who are responsible for the website's oversight.</p>

								<p><b>The goal of this project is to create an NLP model that accurately predicts from which subreddit a given post originated. </b>This will be done by collecting posts from the subreddits 
									<span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/">r/LifeProTips</a></span> and <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyLifeProTips/">r/ShittyLifeProTips</a></span> and classify these posts based on their content. These subreddits include tips that can be used to improve one's life or, on the other hand, "tips" that mock the idea.
									r/LifeProTips is full of helpful advice from reddit users, while r/ShittyLifeProTips is full of content and advice that simply doesn't make sense. <b> So, can we use NLP to discern a good/helpful tip from a bad one, and
									can we use NLP to detect sarcasm and flag it as unhelpful advice?</b>	
								
								<p>Approximately 10,000 posts from each subreddit were collected and used for classification. The data used for analysis, including original subreddit, original title post, word count of original title post, and cleaned title post (without stop words) can be found on <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/NLP_reddit_classification">Github</a></span>.</p>

								<p>After data cleaning and feature engineering, multiple classification models were developed to determine which variation of vectorizer and classifier produced the most accurate model predictions. All together, 12 different combinations were evaluated along with a parameter search for each model. A Logistic Regression model with L2 (Ridge) regularization and TfidfVectorizer with no preprocessing of the titles (i.e., no lemmatizing or stemming of words) performed best. This model accurately predicted the subreddit classification of 76% of the test data based on our input features. </p>

								<p>An accuracy of 76% is not very high but this is also not very surprising. These data sets were very similar to each other, right down to the average word count per title, and these data sets also had very similar word usage. With no discerning qualitites to either data set, an accuracy of 76% is perhaps as high as one can achieve!</p>
