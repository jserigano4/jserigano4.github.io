								<h2>Combatting Air Pollution and Inequality in the US</h2>
								<p>The project described below was a group project completed with two peers. As the only member of the group with experience in atmospheric modeling, I led the group and speerheaded data collection, cleaning, extraction, and interpretation of modeling results.
									More detailed information, including code and further analysis, can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/Air-Quality-in-the-USA">Github</a> and slides for a presentation on this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/Air-Quality-in-the-USA/blob/main/Group%201%20-%20Air%20Quality%20Monitoring%20-%20DSI%20523-1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>Air quality is highly variable in the US and disproportionately affects communities of color. Particulate matter in the atmosphere with a diameter less than 2.5 microns, known as PM2.5, is typically used as a proxy for 
									general air quality. PM2.5 is the leading environmental contributor to the global burden of disease. Particles in this size range are so dangerous because they are able to travel deeply into the respiratory tract, reaching 
									the lungs and affecting lung function as well as exacerbating pre-existing conditions.</p>

								<p>House members introduced a $500 million air quality bill to place new air quality sensors in communities overburdened with pollution. More information about this bill can be found in this <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/representatives-introduce-500-million-air-quality-bill-citing-propublicas-investigations">article</a> from ProPublica. 
									This bill would award grants or contracts to state, local, and tribal agencies to install new air quality monitoring systems around communities afflicted by poor air quality. The EPA does not explicitly state where 
									these monitors should be located and instead delegates the placement of these monitors to the agencies. <b>The goal of this project is to create a model that accurately estimates ground PM2.5 air quality measurements at 
									current EPA monitoring sites using publicly available satellite data. We will then use this model to determine regions in the US that suffer from poor air quality, noted by highly variable PM2.5 predictions in the region 
									or PM2.5 predictions greater than the WHO standard, and recommend locations in the US that could benefit from hyperlocal air quality monitoring. </b>The goal of this project is not to determine the placement of hyperlocal 
									monitors, but instead to determine regions of the US that could benefit from further analysis at higher spatial resolution.</p>
								<p>Long term exposure to fine particulate matter like PM2.5 causes approximately 8 million excess deaths annually, so developing a model that can understand temporal and spatial variability in air pollution is a crucial
									 component to combatting air quality inequalities when ground monitoring is not available. In the US, PM2.5 was associated with about 40,000 premature deaths in 2019, an economic cost that translates to about $500 billion USD. 
									 The health impacts of PM2.5 are not experienced equally in the U.S.: ethnoracial minorities face significantly higher burdens of PM2.5-attributable premature mortality. Sources of PM2.5 include most forms of well-known 
									 pollution: power plants, fossil fuel consumption (traffic, construction, most forms of transportation), burning of wood, and forest and grass fires. Sources also include, to a lesser extent, smoking, cooking, and burning 
									 candles.</p>
								<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
								<p>Publicly available 2019 EPA monthly averaged data for PM2.5 for the contiguous US, which can be found <a href="https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html">here</a>, was used as our target variable. We chose to analyze 2019 because this was the last full pre-pandemic year for which data were available 
									and the pandemic drastically changed global air quality due to lockdowns. Locations of EPA ground monitoring sensors can be seen in the figure below:</p>

										</div>
								<p>Precipitation has a negative correlation to PM2.5 concentration. Precipitation “washes” the air of particulate matter. On the other hand, temperature has a positive correlation to PM2.5 concentration. Higher temperatures 
									lead to more reactions within the atmosphere, leading to more particulate matter. Temperature and precipitation data were pulled from <a href="https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/">NASA GIOVANNI</a>, a data acquisition tool 
									to collect satellite data. Precipitation data 
									comes from the Global Precipitation Monitor satellite at a resolution of 0.1 degrees. Temperature data comes from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite at a resolution
									 of 0.05 degrees.</p>

								<p>NO2 and PM2.5 have similar links to overall health and have similar sources, primarily from the burning of fuel. NO2 forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment and is equally 
									dangerous to health, especially asthma in younger people. NO2 data is collected from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument aboard the Sentinel 5 at a resolution of 0.1 degrees. This data set was used 
									in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2022409118">Kerr et al. 2022</a> and access to the data set can be found <a href="https://gwu.app.box.com/s/8phdj2gtux6gjwzit35skptx8hxl8d9d?">here</a>.</p>
									
								<p>Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a measure of the amount of dust/haze in the atmosphere and tells us how much direct sunlight is prevented from reaching the ground due to aerosol particles. AOD and PM2.5 have a positive 
									correlation since PM2.5 is itself an aerosol. AOD data comes from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite. NASA GIOVANNI only offers these data at a resolution of 
									0.25 degrees. In order to obtain a finer resolution we used a high-resolution gridded data set found in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/17/2847">Gupta et al. 2020</a> which can be found <a href="https://www.nsstc.uah.edu/data/sundar/MODIS_AOD_L3_HRG/AQUA/">here</a>.</p>

								<p>In order to build our data set for modeling, all spatial data had to be collated based on nearest latitude and longitude points to EPA monitoring site locations. Ultimately, 14,000 data points were created based on monthly values 
									of PM2.5 monthly averages at EPA ground monitoring sites from 2019. Each spatial data point consists of an EPA PM2.5 ground measurement and the corresponding monthly average of temperature, precipication, NO2, and AOD measurements from satellite data.
								</p>

								<p>We ran various regression models, including simple, stacked, and neural net models. In the end, our best performing model was a simple RandomForestRegressor() model with hyperparameter tuning. Although the end performance was not ideal, 
									our model was able to account for 94% of variability in the training data set and 71% of variability in the test data set. This suggests that our model is overfit and could perhaps be improved by including additional years of data, 
								performing additional feature selection, and/or including features with high correlation to air pollution such as population density.</p>

								<p>In order to determine locations in the US where the EPA should focus on further air quality monitoring, 1,000 random latitude and longitude data points across the contiguous United States, collated to the closest data point for each feature, were created in order to run through our model 
									to predict monthly PM2.5 values. The location of these random data points compared to the EPA monitoring sites can be found below:</p>

										</div>

								<h2>Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>
								<p>We analyzed two factors to determine recommendations on where the EPA should place new monitors: Average annual PM 2.5 concentration, and annual PM2.5 variability. A high annual PM 2.5 concentration is indicative of an area with a lot 
									of pollution and poor air quality year round. High PM 2.5 variability could be anthropogenic, or could be natural. This includes factories which would pollute only when they are active, cities which would pollute more during commuting 
									hours, and wildfires or other natural causes that create poor air quality.

									A histogram of annual averages for all data points is show below:</p>

										<div class="mydiv">
										<img src="images/annual_average.png" class="imgStyle" />
										</div>

								<p>The World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines (WHO AQG) recommend an annual PM2.5 exposure below 10 &mu;g/m3, which is seen on the figure in a yellow vertical line. Locations above this value have been flagged as recommended sites 
									for monitoring. The figure below shows these locations in blue, with EPA monitor sites shown in orange:</p>
									<style>
										.imgStyle {

										<div class="mydiv">
										<img src="images/rec_highavg.jpeg" class="imgStyle" />
										</div>

								<p>A histogram of PM2.5 variability for all data points is shown below:
								</p>

									<div class="mydiv">
									<img src="images/annual_variability.png" class="imgStyle" />
									</div>

								<p>In this case, there are no guidelines but there are clear outliers to this data set. We set an arbitrary cutoff of 3 and recommend the sites above this value for EPA PM2.5 ground monitoring. 
									The figure below shows these locations in blue, with EPA monitor sites shown in orange:</p>
									<style>
										.imgStyle {
											height: 100%;

										</style>
										<html>
										<div class="mydiv">
										<img src="images/rec_highvar.jpeg" class="imgStyle" />
										</div>

								<p>Both recommendation systems produce similar results. We see some recommended sites at the southern tip of Texas and many other sites on the west coast and specifically the Pacific Northwest. 
									The high PM2.5 and high variability on this coast is most likely due to seasonal wildfires.</p>

								<p>Cleaner input data and more variables would help make predicting ground PM2.5 values from satellite data stronger. The resolution of location data left room for error in the extraction of feature measurements, which could be improved with 
									higher resolution satellite data. Training and testing variability across multiple years could also improve model performance and give more variability insights to determine causes. Additionally, other variables highly correlated to air pollution
									such as proximity to industrial areas and population density could improve modelling efforts. </p>
