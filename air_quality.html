								<h2>Combatting Air Pollution and Inequality in the US</h2>
								<p>The project described below was a group project completed with two peers. As the only member of the group with experience in atmospheric modeling, I led the group and speerheaded data collection, cleaning, extraction, and interpretation of modeling results.
									Below is a brief summary of the project. More detailed information, including code and further analysis, can be found on my <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/Air-Quality-in-the-USA">Github</a></span> and slides for a presentation on this project can be found <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/Air-Quality-in-the-USA/blob/main/Group%201%20-%20Air%20Quality%20Monitoring%20-%20DSI%20523-1.pdf">here</a></span>.</p>
								<h2>Summary</h2>
								<p>Air quality is highly variable in the US and disproportionately affects communities of color. Particulate matter in the atmosphere with a diameter less than 2.5 microns, known as PM2.5, is typically used as a proxy for 
									general air quality. PM2.5 is the leading environmental contributor to the global burden of disease. Particles in this size range are so dangerous because they are able to travel deeply into the respiratory tract, reaching 
									the lungs and affecting lung function as well as exacerbating pre-existing conditions.</p>

								<p>House members introduced a $500 million air quality bill to place new air quality sensors in communities overburdened with pollution. More information about this bill can be found in this <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/representatives-introduce-500-million-air-quality-bill-citing-propublicas-investigations">article</a></span> from ProPublica. 
									This bill would award grants or contracts to state, local, and tribal agencies to install new air quality monitoring systems around communities afflicted by poor air quality. The EPA does not explicitly state where 
									these monitors should be located and instead delegates the placement of these monitors to the agencies. <b>The goal of this project is to create a model that accurately estimates ground PM2.5 air quality measurements at 
									current EPA monitoring sites using publicly available satellite data. We will then use this model to determine regions in the US that suffer from poor air quality, noted by highly variable PM2.5 predictions in the region 
									or PM2.5 predictions greater than the WHO standard, and recommend locations in the US that could benefit from hyperlocal air quality monitoring. </b>Long term exposure to fine particulate matter like PM2.5 causes approximately
									8 million excess deaths annually, so developing a model that can understand temporal and spatial variability in air pollution is a crucial component to combatting air quality inequalities when ground monitoring is not available. </p>

								<p>Publicly available 2019 EPA monthly averaged data for PM2.5 for the contiguous US, which can be found <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html">here</a></span>, was used as our target variable. We chose to analyze 2019 because this was the last full pre-pandemic year for which data were available and the pandemic drastically changed global air quality due to lockdowns. The features used in the model included monthly averaged satellite measurements for precipitation rate, surface temperature, pollution from nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and aerosol optical depth. All of these features are directly correlated to PM2.5 pollution and were pulled from various sources using data acquisition tools from NASA and ESA. </p>
								
								<p>In order to build our data set for modeling, all spatial data had to be collated based on nearest latitude and longitude points to EPA monitoring site locations. Ultimately, 14,000 data points were created based on PM2.5 monthly average measurements at EPA ground monitoring sites from 2019. Each spatial data point consists of an EPA PM2.5 ground measurement and the corresponding monthly average of temperature, precipitation, NO2, and AOD measurements from satellite data.</p>

								<p>Various regression models were created, including simple, stacked, and neural net models. In order to determine locations in the US where the EPA should focus on further air quality monitoring, 1,000 random latitude and longitude data points across the contiguous United States, collated to the closest data point for each feature, were created in order to run through our best performing model to predict monthly ground PM2.5 values from satellite data.</p>
							
								<p>We analyzed two factors to determine recommendations on where the EPA should place new monitors: average annual PM 2.5 concentration, and annual PM2.5 variability. A high annual PM 2.5 concentration is indicative of an area with a lot of pollution and poor air quality year round. High PM 2.5 variability could be anthropogenic, or could be natural. This includes factories which would pollute only when they are active, cities which would pollute more during commuting hours, and wildfires or other natural causes that create poor air quality.</p>
							
								<p>In the end, we were able to use our model to recommend regions in the contiguous US where communities could benefit from further air quality monitoring from the EPA. Most recommended sites included regions in southern Texas and on the west coast, specifically the Pacific Northwest.</p>
