								<h2>Predicting Home Prices in Ames, Iowa</h2>
								<p>Below is a brief summary of my project. More detailed information, including code and further analysis, can be found on my <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/predicting_home_prices_Ames_IA">Github</a></span> and slides for a presentation on this project can be found <span style="background-color: #70C7AA"><a href="https://github.com/jserigano4/predicting_home_prices_Ames_IA/blob/main/predicting_home_prices_Serigano.pdf">here</a></span>.</p>
								<h2>Summary</h2>
								<p>We will examine a housing data set consisting of 82 variables related to home price in Ames, Iowa. As a member of realty company, we will be helping families get their homes ready to sell. The main question we have been tasked with 
									answering is: <b>What characteristics of a home are most likely to increase the sale price, and what changes can be made to increase sale price before putting a home on the market?</b> We will answer these questions by building a 
									Lasso linear regression model that will allow us to evaluate the strength of different home features on home price.</p>

								<p>Since we are interested in what changes can be made to a home to increase sale price, we will only be looking at features in the data set that are capable of being changed by the homeowner. Using a Lasso linear regression model is advantageous because a Lasso model adds a penalty term that minimizes the coefficients of some parameters. In lasso regression, the penalty term has the ability to zero out some coefficients, essentially performing feature selection for us. Thus, this is a desirable model to use when there are many different variables.</p>

								<p>In the end, the model fits the data pretty accurately and can account for 87.2% of the variability in home sale price in the test data. We can conclude from the model that the overall size and quality of material and finish of the house are the most important features affecting home price. Three out of the top five strongest correlations to home price relate to the size of the home: Total square feet, total garage area, and ground floor living area. The amount of bathrooms and fireplaces also have a strong effect on home price, with an increase in the number of either feature having a roughly equal effect on home price.</p>

								<p>Additionally, having a home with a ‘Quality’ rating of anything below 'Excellent' has a very negative impact on home sale price. The two features with the strongest negative correlation are having a home with an exterior material quality deemed 'Typical/Average' and a home with an exterior material quality deemed 'Good' instead of 'Excellent'. Similarly for kitchen quality, 'Typical/Average' and 'Good' ratings have strong negative correlations to price in comparison to a similar home rated as 'Excellent'.</p>

									Below are recommended steps that potential home sellers can follow to increase the sale value of their Ames, IA home before placing it on the market:
								<ul>
									<li>Increase total square footage of your home, especially through ground level living space or garage expansion.</li>
									<li>Add more bathrooms or fireplaces to your home. A new bathroom could also increase square footage.</li>
									<li>Increase the quality of your home's exterior. A home with excellent quality exterior material significantly outperforms a home of lesser exterior quality.</li>
									<li>Similarly, increase the quality of your home's kitchen. A home with a kitchen of excellent quality significantly outperforms a home with a kitchen of lower quality.</li>
								</ul>
